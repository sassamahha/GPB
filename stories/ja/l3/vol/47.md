<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The strict abortion prohibition laws in Texas are making it difficult for women to access quality reproductive health services.</li>
<li>Doctors warn that the ambiguity of the laws is dangerous.</li>
<li>Due to restrictions, women are forced to travel to other states.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shifts in Context</h2>
<h4>① Adult Perspective</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The current issue stems from the legal system and the structure of medical service provision. Laws that limit the options for pregnant women create disparities in medical access depending on the region. Furthermore, doctors continue to assume risks due to the ambiguity in the laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>② Child&#8217;s Perspective</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue affects the choices of families and the adults around them. For example, because treatment is unavailable at a nearby hospital, one might need to travel far away. This can lead to missed days at school or family members being away for long periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>③ Parent&#8217;s Perspective</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>As parents, we are challenged to teach our children about health and the freedom to choose. Instead of waiting for laws to change, it’s crucial to gather information and empower our children with knowledge about their own bodies. It may be time for us to reflect on our own actions and attitudes.</p>

<li>The digitization of healthcare will advance, improving access equality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hypothesis 3 (Pessimistic): A Future Where Women&#8217;s Health Declines</h4>
