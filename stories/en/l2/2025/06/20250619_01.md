## Let's Protect the Environment Together!

### Introduction……

On a quiet afternoon, at a middle school in a city full of greenery, Akihito was attending his usual classes. However, there was a slight unease in his heart. It was the term "eco-anxiety."

"Hey, Akihito. Have you thought about the future?" his friend, Rei, asked. Every time Akihito heard those words, his chest felt uneasy. "Yeah, but it's a bit scary. I can't imagine what will happen to the Earth."

Rei sensed Akihito's anxiety and looked at him with kind eyes. "But there are things we can do. For example, we can reduce plastic use or work hard on recycling."

Hearing that, Akihito thought about what he could do. But inside, he felt a swirl of powerlessness.

One day, on his way home from school, Akihito found trash scattered in a small park. His heart felt heavy, and he became gloomy, thinking he might not be able to do anything. However, at that moment, he made a resolution. "I'll start with what I can do."

The next day, Akihito gathered his friends and proposed a beautification activity for the school. "Let's pick up trash together and make the park a little cleaner!" he exclaimed, and his friends, including Rei, agreed. They decided to not only clean up but also think about environmental issues.

On the day of the activity, Akihito stood in the park with mixed feelings of nervousness and anticipation. Watching the children gather and pick up trash with smiles, he felt his anxiety gradually easing. He realized that by working together, they could accomplish things he couldn't do alone.

After the activity, Akihito was surprised by the amount of trash they had collected. "I can't believe there was this much trash around us," Rei said with a sense of deep reflection. Akihito felt a warm light shining in his heart. "Our small actions might gradually become a big force."

Since that day, Akihito accepted his anxiety and grew by taking action. Instead of fearing eco-anxiety, he found the strength to overcome it.

As time passed, Akihito spread the activities at school and deepened collaboration with the local community. His passion spread to those around him, creating a circle of environmental protection that everyone could join. While acknowledging that he was a small presence, he continued to do what he could, finding a glimmer of hope.

At a gathering one day, Akihito was talking and laughing with his friends. "The future is never dark; if we all work together, we can surely create a bright world!" His words resonated with his friends, and they nodded in agreement. Their smiles shone like the sun illuminating the future.

Thus, Akihito overcame eco-anxiety and gained the power to envision the future alongside his friends. He learned that even a small step could open the path to hope. There was no fear left in his heart. The future was in their hands.
