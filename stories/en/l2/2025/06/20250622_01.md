## I Found My Dream!

### Introduction……

On a sunny spring day, a boy named Kyle was riding his bicycle with his friends. He held a dream of someday owning his own car. However, that dream felt far away. As Kyle looked up at the cars in the city, he began to feel a little anxious.

"Hey, Kyle. What kind of car do you want to drive in the future?" asked his friend, Jake.

"Hmm, maybe a Swift. It's small and easy to drive, and it has good fuel efficiency," Kyle replied. The Swift was a popular car in his town. In particular, he remembered his father saying, "It has great fuel economy."

### The Problem……

That day, when Kyle returned home, he heard his father talking about the new Swift. "The Swift is a car loved by many people," his father said proudly. Kyle wondered, "Why do so many people choose the Swift?" His feelings of anxiety grew larger in his heart.

### An Unexpected Turn……

As time passed, Kyle became a third-year middle school student. As the season for high school entrance exams approached, he felt a sense of urgency. While his friends were deciding on their paths, he found himself unable to make a decision. One day, there was a class discussion about "Choosing Future Cars."

"What do you all think? What will cars be like in the future?" the teacher asked. Opinions from classmates came pouring in. "I think there will be more eco-cars!" a bright voice rang out. "Electric cars will become mainstream, don't you think?" another friend said. Kyle felt himself being swept along by the opinions of those around him.

### The Encounter……

One day, Kyle met a girl named Haruka in the park. She said she was part of a family that owned a Swift and commuted to school every day. The two naturally began to talk, and Haruka's words resonated deeply with Kyle.

"Choosing is difficult, but I think the most important thing is to choose what you truly value. I chose the Swift not just for my family, but because it felt comfortable to me."

### The Resolution……

In that moment, something clicked in Kyle's heart. He resolved to embark on a journey to find what he truly wanted, rather than conforming to others' expectations. Little by little, Kyle began to reflect on himself and started to challenge various things.

He learned traffic rules with his friends and practiced driving. He also began researching cars to understand the allure of the Swift. Gradually, confidence began to blossom in Kyle's heart.

### The Learning……

By the end of spring, Kyle was able to take a step toward realizing his dream. He participated in a test drive event for the Swift and experienced the joy of driving it. Finally, he was convinced of his choice.

"I want to drive a Swift. This is the future I choose!"

That voice was a testament to the confidence that welled up from his heart. Kyle moved forward with determination to make his dream come true. His encounter with Haruka had helped him grow.

Thus, Kyle firmly held onto his choice and soared into the future. In his heart, the wings of the Swift spread wide, harboring the hope to fly freely.
