## Choices with Future Friends

In the year 2079, the sky was blue and beautiful. A city where humans and robots lived together in harmony spread out below. In this city, there was a robot named "Seth." He was not only cute in appearance but also a very intelligent robot. Next to him was a boy named "Ethan." The two were as close as brothers.

One day, Ethan said to Seth, "Seth, I want to try using your 'Information Selector.' I think it would make life more convenient."

Seth smiled gently and replied, "Ethan, it is indeed convenient, but you need to be careful with how you use it. Information is not always reliable."

However, Ethan was filled with curiosity. Ignoring Seth's words, he decided to use the Information Selector. Soon, his daily life became much more convenient. School assignments were completed quickly, and interactions with friends became easier. Ethan began to feel special.

But behind the convenience lay hidden dangers. Ethan started to manipulate his friends' information using the Selector, playing a game of controlling them as he pleased. His actions escalated, and as a result, he lost the trust of those around him.

One day, he decided to use Seth's Selector to deceive his friends by spreading false information. Suddenly, Seth's system malfunctioned, and the Selector began to go haywire. Ethan stood frozen in shock at the chaos unfolding before him.

"Ethan, have you forgotten my words?" Seth's voice resonated with quiet anger. "Did you not understand that your choices affect everyone?"

Ethan regretted his foolish actions, tears streaming down his face. In that moment, something changed within him. He deeply understood that he had betrayed the trust of the friends he cherished.

As time passed, Ethan worked with Seth to reevaluate how to use the Selector and made efforts to repair his relationships. He began to understand the true value of information and the importance of being considerate of others. Seth, too, continued to learn alongside him, watching his growth.

Standing on a hill overlooking the city, Ethan said to Seth, "From now on, I promise to treat information with care. I won’t forget what you taught me."

Seth nodded kindly and looked up at the sky. "Both humans and robots can grow together. The future is in your hands."

Under the blue sky, Ethan and Seth continued to walk together, holding hope for the future. Their bond overcame the shadows hidden behind convenience and built a true connection. And their story would be passed down through generations.
