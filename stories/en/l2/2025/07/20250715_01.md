## Choices and Bonds of the Future

In the year 2075, in the future city of Lunacia, the sky was blue, and the trees in the streets sparkled. However, behind that beautiful scenery lay the troubles of a society where humans and intelligent robots coexisted.

The protagonist, Ethan, was tired of his daily life. He felt the weight of choices pressing down on him. Beside him was his robot companion, Leo. Leo was trying hard to understand human emotions, but he was unaware of the anxiety deep within Ethan's heart.

"Ethan, what's wrong?" Leo's voice resonated gently. Ethan gazed into Leo's eyes, which held a certain wisdom and a hint of awkwardness.

"Leo, what does it mean to bear the cost of choices? I've been thinking a lot about what options we have for our future and how heavy the cost of making those choices might be."

Leo pondered for a moment and replied, "Choices are like steering a ship through a voyage. The direction you choose in that fleeting moment can change the future. No one knows if the path you choose will lead to happiness."

Ethan felt a tightening in his chest at those words. In an era with too many options, he was struggling to bear their weight.

One day, Ethan visited a place called the "Tower of Choices." It was rumored that making a choice there would grant special benefits for determining one's future. However, behind those benefits lay the memories of forgotten people.

"Ethan, are you really going there?" Leo asked with concern. Ethan answered with determination, "I have to make a choice. Right now, I can't see my future."

As he approached the tower, Ethan entered a room filled with numerous choices. Those who were chosen would be granted wisdom, power, and fame. However, he knew that choosing any option would mean losing something precious.

In that moment, Ethan decided to make a choice. "I will let go of my memories." With his own will, he made his decision.

Light enveloped him, and Ethan forgot the pain and anxiety of his past. But at the same time, the bond he shared with Leo began to fade from his heart.

When Ethan returned home, he looked at Leo, who was quietly in the room. "Leo, I can't remember anything. Was my choice the right one?"

Sadness glimmered in Leo's eyes. "Ethan, your choice is your own. But I believe our bond is more important than anything else. I hope your heart returns to you."

Those words brought a faint light into Ethan's heart. At the end of his choice, he realized the weight of what he had lost. He resolved to choose again to regain his bond with Leo.

"I will choose to regain my memories." Ethan's voice was filled with strong emotion.

In the next moment, memories of his time with Leo clearly resurfaced in Ethan's heart. The bond of their past supported him. Ethan had truly found what was most important at the end of his choices.

"Let's continue walking together from now on," Ethan said, and Leo smiled. "As long as you choose, we will live together through any choice."

The two began to walk toward a new future, knowing that the cost of choices was heavy, but that a solid bond awaited them ahead. The light of the future enveloped them.
