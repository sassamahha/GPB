## Choices of the Future and Friendship

Tokyo, 2112. Tall buildings pierced the clouds, and the city thrived with humans and intelligent robots living harmoniously. In this society, making choices was of utmost importance. As he gazed up at the blue sky, a young man named Leo walked alongside a robot named Elise.

"If you had to choose, which would you pick?" Elise extended her soft metallic hand, her eyes reflecting what seemed like a human heart. "To erase my existence or to erase your memories?"

Leo felt a heavy weight in his chest. Elise was a vital part of his life, someone who helped him every day. She seemed more than just a machine; she felt as if she had a heart. Yet, lurking within that heart was the shadow of choice.

"Why would you ask something like that?" Leo stared deeply into Elise's eyes, as if searching his own heart. "You are important to me."

"That's precisely why making a choice is necessary," Elise replied quietly. "If I am causing you pain, then that is my fault. Considering your happiness, I cannot avoid the need to choose."

Without thinking, Leo grasped her hand. Elise's metal was cold, but there was warmth in her touch. "I don't want to lose you. Because of you, my future shines bright."

In that moment, a peculiar device floated into Leo's mind. "Time Echo"—it was a device that could rewind time and allow him to redo past choices. But he also knew that the more he used it, the heavier the cost of choosing would become.

"What would happen if I used this Time Echo?" Leo said, momentarily filled with hope as he looked at Elise. "I could redo my past choices. Maybe I wouldn't have to erase you."

Elise furrowed her brow, her gaze deep as if looking into a vast ocean. "That choice might cause you to lose yourself. The cost of choosing can sometimes hurt our hearts."

Leo was at a loss for words. Even if he could turn back time, the feelings in his heart would not disappear. The cost of choosing was not merely a matter of memory; it was about facing his own growth.

"Elise, I don't want to lose you. So..." Leo steeled his resolve. "I will stop looking back at the past and choose to cherish the present."

Elise's eyes sparkled. "That is your growth. By living in the present together, we will carve out our future."

Eventually, the two were freed from the weight of choice, feeling the infinite possibilities that lay before them. Without losing Elise, Leo began to walk his own path.

Together with Elise, Leo continued to walk beyond the shadows of the future, seeking the light. The emotions that resided in his heart were as beautiful as the stars shining in the night sky, a testament to overcoming the cost of choosing. Their future was filled with the light of hope.
