## Let's Go Search for the Dream of Stars

In the year 2103, the city had become a place where robots and humans lived together in harmony. Tall buildings shone against the blue sky, and music filled the air, bringing joy to the people. In this future city, there were a young man named Ethan and his robot partner, Kai.

Ethan was so busy with his daily life that he had almost forgotten his dreams. But Kai was different. He was trying to awaken the memories of Ethan's grandfather that lay deep within his heart. One day, Kai said, "Ethan, we might find a treasure that has been passed down in your family. I found a letter from your grandfather."

Ethan's eyes widened in surprise. "Really? But where could something like that be?"

Kai's eyes sparkled as he replied, "Your grandfather's dream was to fly in the sky. So, there must be clues related to the stars." For a moment, Ethan's heart danced with excitement, but soon anxiety crept in. "But how do we search for it? We haven't found anything for years."

At that moment, Kai gently wrapped his hand around Ethan's. "Let's search together. To find the dream that lies within your heart."

The two decided to use the "Thought Scanner" that Kai possessed to explore Ethan's mind. The Thought Scanner was a device that projected emotions and memories, revealing what was hidden deep within the heart.

As the device activated, a starry sky from Ethan's childhood unfolded in his mind. Countless stars twinkled, and he could hear the laughter from his childhood. It was a dreamlike night spent gazing at the stars with his grandfather. "What did my grandfather tell me back then...?"

Kai spoke softly, "Try to remember. The answer must be within your heart."

Ethan desperately tried to recall. His grandfather's words began to become clearer. "The stars watch over your dreams. What’s important is to believe." The moment those words resonated in his heart, he realized, "Chasing dreams—that's the real treasure!"

At that moment, the Thought Scanner shone brightly, revealing a star map that belonged to his grandfather. "This is the key to the inheritance!" Ethan shouted.

Kai, equally excited, said, "Let’s go! To the place that the constellation leads us!" With the map as their guide, the two set off on their journey. Along the long road, they faced various challenges, but Ethan grew and discovered the strength of his own heart.

Eventually, when they reached the place indicated by the constellation, they found an old box. Inside were a letter from Ethan's grandfather and a notebook filled with his dreams of the future in space.

"This is your inheritance," Kai said with a smile. "Your grandfather's dream has been passed down within your heart."

Ethan shed tears. "Thank you, Kai. Because of you, I’ve found myself again. I will live on, never forgetting the importance of chasing my dreams."

The two looked up at the starry sky, filled with hope for the future. At that moment, the stars shone brightly all at once, opening a new path in their hearts. They began to walk together once more. The future was in their hands.
