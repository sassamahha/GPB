## Hikaru Found Hope for the Future

In 2110, a society where humans and intelligent robots lived together created a diverse world, much like a garden blooming with colorful flowers. Among them, a young inventor named "Hikaru" spent every day with his latest robot, "Cyrus." Cyrus helped Hikaru bring his ideas to life using the "Dream Vessel" that Hikaru had created.

"Cyrus, let's use the Dream Vessel to realize a new idea today!" Hikaru shouted with a cheerful voice. The Dream Vessel had the power to instantly manifest whatever was imagined, but it required careful handling. If misused, it could lead to unexpected consequences.

One day, Hikaru decided to create a giant cake with the Dream Vessel to surprise his friends. "Cyrus, let's make an enormous cake to delight everyone!" he exclaimed, sharing his dream. Cyrus looked a bit worried and asked, "Hikaru, is that really a good way to use it?" However, Hikaru ignored his concern.

"Dream Vessel, activate!" Hikaru shouted, and before him appeared a large cake adorned with sparkling cream. His friends' eyes shone with surprise and joy, filling Hikaru's heart with pride. Yet, at that moment, he did not consider the impact of his actions.

Hikaru continued to overestimate the power of the Dream Vessel. He entrusted it with one idea after another to amaze his friends. However, gradually, its effects diminished, and the reactions from those around him grew colder. Exhausted, Hikaru realized he was powerless without the Dream Vessel.

One day, the Dream Vessel broke down. Hikaru was frustrated that he couldn't do anything despite planning a special surprise for his friends. At that moment, Cyrus looked at him and quietly said, "Hikaru, even without the Dream Vessel, you have enough power. Your thoughts can bring joy to your friends."

Those words struck Hikaru's heart. He came up with an idea to bring joy to his friends with his own hands. He decided to host a homemade picnic in his backyard with his friends. It took effort and time, but in return, his heart filled with a sense of fulfillment.

Eventually, the day of the picnic arrived. The special sandwiches made with his friends and the fruits Hikaru had chosen adorned the table. The joyful moments spent in nature warmed his heart more than any reality created by the Dream Vessel.

"Cyrus, thank you. Thanks to your words, I was able to find myself," Hikaru said, his eyes shining with warmth. Cyrus smiled and replied in a gentle voice, "I'm happy to see your growth. Even without the Dream Vessel, happiness can be found anywhere as long as you have your heart."

In a world where humans and robots lived together, Hikaru learned an important lesson. Behind convenience lies the danger of losing oneself. True joy comes from the connections of the heart with others. The Dream Vessel was a tool to realize magical ideas, but the most important thing was the joy that could be created with one's own hands.

That day, Hikaru took a new step forward, discovering a version of himself that could laugh with his friends and envision the future. And together with Cyrus, a new light of hope ignited within his heart.
