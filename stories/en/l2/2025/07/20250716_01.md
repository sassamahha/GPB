## Journey to Know the Past

In 2056, the city quietly embraced the shadows of time. Tall buildings lined the sky, seemingly reaching for the future. In this society where humans and intelligent robots lived together, people were forgetting the past to create a new world.

That day, a young man named Ethan was caught up in the demands of his daily work, yet somewhere in his heart, he pondered the lost past. His robot partner, Leo, sensed Ethan's feelings keenly. "Ethan, what are you thinking about?" Leo asked in a gentle voice.

Ethan sighed slightly and replied, "Leo, where has our past gone? Everyone is forgetting the past and moving towards the future, but I want to know that past."

Leo thought for a moment and then smiled brightly. "Well then, let's go look for it together. How about embarking on a journey to find the things of the past?"

Ethan nodded, a mix of surprise and anticipation filling him. Leo quickly searched for data and discovered that there was a place called "Memory House" where remnants of the past could be found. It was said to contain items filled with the memories of people from long ago.

On their way to "Memory House," Ethan felt a bit anxious. He was torn between fear and excitement about what knowing the past might bring him. However, with Leo by his side, courage began to swell within him.

When they arrived at "Memory House," it felt like a mysterious place where time had stopped. Old books, photographs, and vintage household items were displayed, as if history was speaking to them.

Ethan picked up a photograph. It captured the smiling face of his grandmother. In that moment, he felt something inside him burst with emotion. "Leo, this is my grandmother. I wonder what kind of life she lived..."

"Your past is a part of you. Even if forgotten, it continues to live on in your heart," Leo said gently.

Hearing those words, a warm feeling surged within Ethan's heart. By knowing the past, he rediscovered himself, and the path to the future became brighter.

A few days later, Ethan returned to his daily life with a renewed determination. "Leo, our journey isn't over. From now on, let's pass down the stories of the past. We will protect the memories that people have forgotten."

Leo nodded and smiled happily. "And we will play the role of connecting those memories to the future. As long as we are together, the past and the future can become one."

With newfound hope in his heart, Ethan began to walk alongside Leo. The light of the past resided within him, illuminating the shadows of the future. In this future society where humans and robots lived together, forgetting was no longer a shadow but a force that deepened their bond.
