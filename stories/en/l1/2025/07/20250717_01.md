## On a Starless Night

On a night in 2023,  
Selina was sitting in the park.  
Beside her was  
a copper-colored robot,  
Astraeus.  

"Selina, did you dream again?"  
Astraeus's voice was  
like a gentle breeze.  

Selina looked up at the sky.  
The sky was filled with many spaceships,  
shining brightly.  
"Yeah, in my dream,  
the stars disappeared."  

Astraeus asked,  
"What did you lose sight of?"  
"The sparkle of the stars.  
At that moment,  
I was looking at myself."  

Selina's words  
reflected her feelings like a mirror.  
Astraeus thought for a moment.  
"Then let's bring the stars back!"  

"Let's create new stars in the night!"  
Selina was filled with excitement.  
The two of them  
began searching for reasons  
why the stars were not visible.  

"Let's make a device to reduce the park's light!"  
Selina was brimming with determination.  
But at first,  
it was nothing but failures.  
The device broke,  
or the light increased.  

"Why isn't it working?"  
Tears welled up in Selina's eyes.  
Astraeus patted her shoulder.  
"Failure is the first step to success."  

"The light of the stars  
is within our hearts."  
With those words,  
Selina tried once more.  
She searched for new ideas  
and challenged various methods.  

A few months later,  
a new device was completed.  
"I'm going for it, Astraeus!"  
Selina's voice  
echoed to the stars.  

When they activated the device,  
a new light emerged in the night.  
"Look, Astraeus!  
The stars have come back!"  

Joy radiated from Selina's face.  
Astraeus also rejoiced  
at Selina's smile.  

"Our efforts have paid off."  
Astraeus smiled.  
"The stars will  
live on in our hearts forever."  

Hearing those words,  
Selina felt an even stronger resolve.  
Humans and robots  
could join hands  
and open up the future.  
The stars in the night  
watched over their growth.
