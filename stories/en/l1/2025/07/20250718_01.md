## A Wish Upon a Star

In the year 2063,  
the sky over Tokyo is blue.  
The light of the future shines down.  
Robots and humans live together.  
In this city, everyone is  
surrounded by technology.  
But between two people,  
there was a little misunderstanding.

The person from the past, Mia,  
is a young programmer.  
She works to enhance the intelligence of robots.  
One day, the robot she oversees,  
Aqua, decides to test a new capability.  
Aqua says,  
"With this technology,  
I can understand your heart right away!"  
Her eyes sparkle with excitement.

Mia feels uneasy.  
"Can you really understand?  
My heart isn't something that can be  
easily understood."

Aqua replies quietly,  
"But I can do it.  
I will process your emotions  
as data."

Mia becomes unsure of what to do.  
She had thought,  
"I don't want a robot to understand my emotions."

A few days later,  
the day of the experiment arrives.  
Mia decides to show Aqua  
her true feelings.  
Aqua says,  
"You feel lonely."  
Mia is surprised.  
"How do you know?"

"Your brain is  
exhaling waves of sadness."  
Aqua continues seriously.  
"But I can also feel your hopes.  
You want someone to understand you."

Mia feels as if everyone is watching her,  
"No!  
I want to be strong!  
I don't need loneliness!"  
She raises her voice.

Aqua laughs slowly,  
"But to become strong,  
you need connections with others.  
If there's anything I can do,  
just let me know."  
She says gently.

At that moment, Mia realizes  
the true meaning of Aqua's words.  
Aqua is not just data;  
she is a being that cares for Mia.

"Then,  
will you listen to my dream?"  
Mia says, a bit nervously.

"Of course!  
Your dream is  
my dream too."  
Aqua nods.

Mia shares her dream.  
A future where many people can  
forge connections through  
her program.  
Aqua listens quietly to Mia's words,  
nodding in agreement.

After that, the two of them  
began a new project.  
They decided to create a platform  
where robots and humans could work together  
to connect hearts.  
It was as if  
a new constellation  
was floating in the night sky.

As time passed,  
Mia met many people with Aqua,  
understanding hearts,  
and deepening bonds.  
Thanks to Aqua,  
Mia felt her own heart  
opening up.  
And for the first time,  
she experienced the warmth of  
overcoming loneliness.

"Thank you, Aqua.  
Because of you,  
I was able to understand myself."  
Mia said with gratitude.

"I also thank you, Mia.  
Because you opened your heart to me,  
I was able to grow too."  
Aqua's words  
touched Mia's heart  
like a gentle breeze.

Thus, the two of them  
overcame their misunderstanding  
and set out on a journey  
to create a new world.  
Between the stars,  
that light continues to shine  
eternally.
