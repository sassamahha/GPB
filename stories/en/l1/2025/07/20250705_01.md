## At the Intersection of Light

In the year 2069,  
a city with a blue sky,  
Thunder City.  
Humans and robots  
lived together.  
In the center of the city,  
there were many sparkling buildings.  
Among them,  
there was a small café.  
Its name was  
"The Intersection of Light."  

There,  
a young man named  
Haruto was with his robot friend,  
Ria.  
Ria was a robot  
who understood the human heart well.  
For Haruto,  
Ria was a precious light.  
However, Haruto was  
burdened with anxiety.  
He wanted to become a doctor,  
but he lacked confidence.  

"Haruto, what's wrong?  
You seem down today,"  
Ria asked with a smile.  
Her eyes were  
as warm as the starry sky.  

"Yeah, just a bit...  
the future feels uncertain.  
The exam is coming up,  
but I have no confidence at all,"  
Haruto replied.  

"Anxiety is like  
a shadow of the heart.  
But shadows are born  
only when there is light.  
So,  
believe in your light,  
and try to move forward,"  
Ria said.  

At that moment,  
the wind chime on the café wall,  
listening to their conversation,  
thought about Haruto's feelings.  
Then,  
music began to play  
to help dispel the anxiety.  
Haruto's face  
softened a little.  
Ria smiled,  
seeing this change.  

"Look,  
the music is  
surrounding you.  
It might be nice to  
travel through your heart  
and find peace,"  
Ria said.  

Haruto felt  
the anxiety in his heart  
fade away with the music.  
"You're right,  
Ria. Because you're here,  
I can gradually stand up again,"  
Haruto said.  
At that moment,  
a gentle light  
sparkled in Ria's eyes.  

As the exam day  
approached,  
Haruto spent his days  
studying with Ria.  
Ria conducted various simulations  
and taught him gently,  
making it easy for Haruto to understand.  
Their interaction  
created a harmony  
like music.  

On the day of the exam,  
Haruto was so nervous  
that his hands trembled.  
When he entered the venue,  
Ria's words  
resonated in his heart.  
"Believe in your light and move forward."  
Those words pushed Haruto forward.  

When the results were announced,  
Haruto waited with anxiety and anticipation.  
When his name was called,  
and the announcement of his acceptance came,  
his heart expanded with joy.  
Haruto ran to Ria,  
expressing his gratitude.  
"Ria,  
I passed!  
It's all thanks to you!"  

"Congratulations, Haruto.  
Your light has become  
a power that illuminates everyone,"  
Ria smiled.  

Thus,  
Haruto took a step  
toward the future.  
His bond with Ria  
deepened even more.  
The sight of humans and robots  
growing together,  
realizing their dreams,  
was as beautiful and free  
as balloons soaring into the blue sky.  
The story of the two  
had just begun.
