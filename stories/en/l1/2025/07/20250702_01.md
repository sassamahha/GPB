## The Future's Blue Fantasy

In the year 2020,  
humans and robots  
live together in society.  
It is like a garden  
where various flowers bloom.  

Among them,  
there was a young inventor  
named "Hikari."  
Hikari's friend,  
the robot "Cyrus,"  
helps Hikari with  
her ideas.  

"Cyrus,  
let's use the Dream Device  
to come up with new  
ideas today!"  
Hikari exclaimed happily.  

However,  
the Dream Device  
required caution.  
"If you use it incorrectly,  
it could be a disaster."  

One day,  
Hikari wanted to surprise  
her friends,  
so she decided to make  
a big cake  
with the Dream Device.  

"Cyrus,  
let's create a special cake  
to make everyone happy!"  
When Hikari said this,  
Cyrus asked a bit  
anxiously,  
"Hikari, is that really  
a good way to use it?"  

But Hikari ignored  
that voice.  
"Dream Device,  
activate!"  
Hikari shouted,  
and a large cake  
appeared before her.  

Her friends' eyes  
sparkled with  
surprise and joy.  
Hikari was thrilled,  
but at that moment,  
she didn't think about  
the consequences of her actions.  

Hikari overused the Dream Device.  
After that,  
she kept creating  
surprising ideas one after another.  
But gradually,  
her friends' evaluations  
diminished,  
and Hikari became exhausted.  

One day,  
the Dream Device broke down.  
Hikari, who had been  
thinking of a surprise  
for her friends,  
became frustrated  
with her inability to do anything.  

At that moment,  
Cyrus looked at Hikari and said,  
"Hikari,  
even without the Dream Device,  
you have enough  
strength within you."  

Those words moved  
Hikari's heart.  
She thought of an idea  
to make her friends happy  
with her own hands.  

She decided to host  
a handmade picnic  
in her own garden  
with her friends.  
It took time,  
but Hikari's heart  
was filled with joy.  

Eventually,  
the day of the picnic  
arrived.  
Sandwiches made with her friends,  
and fruits chosen by Hikari  
were laid out.  

In nature,  
everyone's smiles  
warmed Hikari's heart  
more than anything  
the Dream Device could create.  

"Cyrus,  
thank you.  
With your words,  
I found myself."  
Hikari said.  
Cyrus smiled and replied,  
"I'm happy to see your growth.  
Even without the Dream Device,  
if you have your heart,  
happiness can be found  
anywhere."  

Hikari learned  
an important lesson.  
Behind convenience,  
there is a danger  
of losing oneself.  
True joy  
comes from  
the connection of hearts  
with others.  

That day,  
Hikari took a new step,  
laughing with her friends,  
and discovered  
that she could  
create the future.  

And together with Cyrus,  
a new light of hope  
shone in Hikari's heart.
