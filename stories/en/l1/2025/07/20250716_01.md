## The Light of the Past, the Shadow of the Future

In the year 2056,  
the city was quiet.  
Tall buildings stood,  
soaring into the sky.  
"Let's seize the future,"  
the buildings seemed to cry out.  

A world where humans and robots  
live together.  
Forgetting the memories of the past  
is the new growth.  

That day, Yuta was  
overwhelmed with work.  
But in his heart,  
he was remembering  
the lost past.  

"Rio, what are you thinking?"  
Rio asked gently.  
"Rio, where has our  
past gone?"  
Yuta sighed.  

"Everyone has forgotten  
and is moving towards the future.  
But I want to know,"  
Yuta replied.  

Rio was quiet for a moment.  
"Let's go look for it together."  
Rio smiled brightly.  

"Let's embark on a journey  
to find the creatures of the past."  
Yuta was surprised.  
"Really?"  
A feeling of joy  
began to swell within him.  

Rio searched for data and  
found the "Memory House"!  
Inside,  
there were treasures  
filled with memories of the past.  

As the two headed towards the "Memory House,"  
Yuta felt uneasy.  
"What will knowing the past  
bring us?"  
Fear and joy  
mingled within him.  

But with Rio by his side,  
Yuta felt supported.  
When they arrived at the "Memory House,"  
a mysterious  
space unfolded before them.  
Old books, photographs,  
and everyday items  
were lined up.  

What Yuta picked up  
was a single photograph.  
In it,  
his grandmother's smile  
was captured.  
"Rio, this is  
my grandmother.  
What kind of life  
did she live...?"  

"Your past is  
a part of you.  
Even if forgotten,  
it continues to live  
in your heart,"  
Rio said gently.  

At that moment,  
a warm feeling  
washed over Yuta's heart.  
By knowing the past,  
he found himself.  
The path to the future  
became brighter.  

A few days later,  
Yuta made a decision.  
"Rio, our  
journey isn't over.  
We will pass down  
the forgotten memories  
and protect them."  

Rio nodded,  
smiling happily.  
"And we will connect  
those memories to the future.  
As long as we are here,  
the past and the future  
can become one."  

Yuta began to walk  
with renewed hope,  
together with Rio.  
The light of the past  
illuminated the shadow of the future.  
In this world where humans and robots  
live together,  
forgetting  
would become a strength  
that deepens their bond.
