## Shadows and Light of the Future

In the year 2022 in Tokyo,  
tall buildings towered into the sky.  
The city was a place where  
humans and robots lived together.  

"If you had to choose one,  
what would you do?" the robot, Alice,  
extended a gentle hand.  
"Would you erase me, or  
erase your memories?"  

Kouki felt a chill.  
Alice had always  
helped him.  
She was not just a machine;  
it felt like she had a heart.  

"Why would you say something like that?"  
Kouki gazed at Alice.  
"You are an important presence."  

"That's why it's necessary to choose."  
Alice replied quietly.  
"When I think about your happiness,  
I can't avoid making a choice."  

Kouki took Alice's hand.  
"I don't want to lose you.  
Because you are here,  
my future shines."  

At that moment,  
a strange gadget floated into Kouki's mind. "Time Echo"—  
it was a device that could  
turn back time.  

"What would happen if I used this Time Echo?"  
Kouki said to Alice.  
"I could redo the past.  
Maybe I wouldn't have to erase you."  

Alice furrowed her brow.  
"That choice might lead to losing yourself.  
The importance of choosing  
doesn't lighten the heart."  

Kouki couldn't say anything.  
Even if he went back to the past,  
the feelings in his heart wouldn't disappear.  
The importance of choosing  
was about facing his own growth.  

"Alice, I don't want to lose you.  
So..." Kouki resolved,  
"I'll stop looking back at the past  
and cherish the present."  

Alice's eyes sparkled.  
"That is your growth.  
Let's live in the present together  
and create the future."  

Eventually, the two of them  
were liberated from the weight of choice.  
Before their eyes,  
infinite possibilities  
spread out before them.  

Kouki, together with Alice,  
continued walking beyond the shadows of the future,  
seeking the light.  
In their hearts,  
there was a testament that transcended choice.  
Their future was  
filled with the light of hope.
