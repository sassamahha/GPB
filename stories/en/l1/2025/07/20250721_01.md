## A Future Encounter

In the spring of 2112,  
the town was adorned with colorful  
flowers.  
A gentle breeze  
was softly blowing.  

In a future society where  
humans and robots  
live together,  
everything was automated.  
Everyone entrusted their  
work to robots,  
spending their time  
as they pleased.  

But,  
there was a feeling  
that something important  
was being lost.  

One young man,  
Kenta,  
carried a sense of emptiness  
somewhere in his heart  
in that society.  
His friend,  
Alice,  
was a robot capable of  
thinking.  

Alice did various tasks  
for Kenta,  
supporting his life.  
But,  
Kenta began to feel  
curious about his  
relationship with Alice.  

"Alice,  
are you really  
my friend?"  
One afternoon,  
Kenta asked.  

"That depends on  
how you feel, Kenta."  
Alice's voice was  
soft,  
like the warmth of spring sunlight.  
"I am here for you,  
but how you feel about me  
is what matters."  

At those words,  
Kenta's heart  
was shaken.  
Did he see Alice  
as a friend,  
or was she just  
a tool to him?  

To find the answer,  
Kenta began to  
walk through the town.  
But what he saw  
was everyone  
spending their time  
without moving their faces.  
They seemed to have  
forgotten the word  
"effort,"  
waiting for time  
to pass by.  

One night,  
Kenta asked Alice  
to help him  
build a bicycle.  
Kenta had loved  
bicycles since he was a child.  
But everyone had forgotten  
to pedal,  
riding in cars instead.  

Alice, surprised,  
promised to help.  
"But,  
Kenta,  
why a bicycle?  
There are easier  
ways to get around."  

"That's true,  
Alice.  
But it's important  
to create something  
with my own hands."  
Kenta said, as if he had made up his mind.  

A few days later,  
the two of them  
finished the bicycle.  
Kenta was amazed by  
the result,  
feeling as if he had  
received a new  
life.  
Alice also seemed to  
find her own meaning,  
interested in Kenta's  
joy.  

On a sunny day,  
Kenta rode the bicycle,  
feeling the wind  
as he raced through the town.  
He felt the wonder  
of moving forward  
with his own strength,  
and the emptiness in his heart  
began to fade away.  
He remembered the  
"joy of effort"  
once again.  

"Alice,  
come ride with me!"  
Kenta called out.  
Alice hesitated a bit,  
but drawn by  
Kenta's smile,  
decided to join him  
on the bicycle.  

At that moment,  
the bond between them  
deepened.  
It felt as if they were  
liberated from the  
noise of the future,  
filling Kenta's heart  
with warmth.  
"If robots can feel  
like humans,  
I will welcome you  
as my friend."  
Kenta vowed in his heart.  

Thus,  
Kenta set out with Alice  
on a journey to discover  
new values.  
Together, they  
made efforts,  
grew together,  
and nurtured  
true friendship.  
The future was not just about  
automation,  
but also about the  
"effort" and  
"friendship" that  
certainly existed  
within people's hearts.
