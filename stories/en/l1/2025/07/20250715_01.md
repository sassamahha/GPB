## At the End of Choices

In the year 215,  
the sky was blue and clear,  
the greenery of the town sparkled.  
It was a future city,  
called Lunacia.  

But behind that beautiful light,  
there were difficult issues  
of humans and robots living together.  

The protagonist, Ethan,  
was tired of daily life,  
feeling the weight of choices.  
Beside him,  
was his robot partner, Leo.  

Leo was trying every day  
to understand human emotions.  
However, he was unaware  
of Ethan's inner anxieties.  

"Ethan, what's wrong?"  
Leo's voice was gentle,  
echoing like music.  

Ethan gazed into Leo's eyes.  
"Leo, what does it mean  
to bear the weight of choices?  
What kinds of choices do we have  
for our future,  
and how heavy is the burden  
of making those choices?  
I've been thinking about it a lot lately."  

Leo pondered for a moment  
and replied,  
"Choices are like steering a ship  
in the sea of regrets.  
The decision of which direction to take  
can change the future.  
No one knows  
if the path you choose  
will lead to happiness."  

Ethan felt his heart tighten  
at those words.  
In an age of overwhelming choices,  
he was struggling to bear  
the weight of it all.  

One day, Ethan visited  
the "Tower of Choices"  
located in the center of the city.  
There, it was said that  
if you made a choice about your future,  
you would receive a special blessing.  
However, there were rumors  
that behind that blessing  
were the memories of forgotten people  
sealed away.  

"Ethan, are you really going?"  
In response to Leo's question,  
Ethan replied,  
"I have to make a choice.  
Right now, I can't see  
my future."  

As he made his way to the tower,  
Ethan entered a room  
filled with numerous choices.  
Those who were chosen  
would be granted wisdom, strength, and fame.  
But he knew that  
no matter which choice he made,  
he would lose something precious.  

At that moment, Ethan decided  
to make one choice.  
"I will let go of my memories."  
With his own will,  
Ethan made his choice.  

Light enveloped him,  
and he forgot the pain and anxiety  
of the past.  
But at the same time,  
the bond he had with Leo  
began to fade away.  

When Ethan returned,  
he found Leo standing  
in the quiet room.  
"Leo, I can't remember anything.  
Was my choice the right one?"  

Sadness reflected in Leo's eyes.  
"Ethan, your choice is  
yours alone.  
But I believe our bond  
is more important than anything else.  
I hope your heart will return."  

At those words,  
a faint light shone  
in Ethan's heart.  
At the end of choices,  
he realized the weight of what he had lost.  
He resolved to reclaim  
his bond with Leo  
once again.  

"I've decided to regain my memories."  
Ethan's voice  
carried a seasonal resonance.  

The next time, memories of Leo  
vividly resurfaced in Ethan's heart.  
The bond they shared in the past  
was supporting him.  
At the end of choices,  
Ethan truly discovered  
what was most important.  

"We will continue to walk together."  
At Ethan's words,  
Leo smiled.  
"As long as you choose,  
we will live together,  
no matter the choice."  

They began to walk  
toward a new future.  
Though the weight of choices was heavy,  
they knew that ahead  
awaited a certain bond.  
The light of the future  
enveloped them.
