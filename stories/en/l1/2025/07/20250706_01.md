## The Interstice of Time

In the year 2034,  
in a town where the blue sky is visible,  
Azalea.  
In this town, where humans and robots live together harmoniously,  
a boy named Ethan  
is about to have a mysterious experience.

Next to Ethan,  
there is a cute robot named Alice.  
Alice is Ethan's friend.  
She understands the loneliness in Ethan's heart.  
By playing with Alice,  
Ethan forgets his worries  
and spends quiet moments.

But that day,  
on his way home from school,  
Ethan encounters a strange event.  
In the center of the town,  
a large clock tower  
suddenly starts turning backward!  
The people around are bewildered.  
Alice asks, "Ethan,  
what's happening?" with a worried expression.

"I don't know.  
But somehow,  
it feels like something important is about to happen..."  
Deep down, Ethan senses  
that something is beginning.

As the clock tower continues to turn backward,  
Ethan and Alice are struck by a peculiar sensation.  
It feels as if  
the perception of time is distorting.  
Then,  
after a few minutes,  
it felt like they returned to the original time.  
But,  
something was different.  
Ethan realized  
he was repeating the same day.

"Is this  
time looping?"  
Ethan exclaimed in surprise,  
and Alice looked serious at his words.

"As far as I can analyze,  
this phenomenon might be occurring under specific conditions.  
By figuring it out,  
we might be able to break the loop."  
Thus,  
the two of them began to devise a plan  
to solve this mysterious phenomenon.

Every time,  
on the way home from school,  
they return to the moment  
when the clock tower starts turning backward.  
Ethan tries a different approach each time,  
but they all end in failure.  
Anxiety built up in Ethan's heart.

One day,  
in a sudden moment,  
Ethan realizes something.  
Amidst repeating the same failures,  
what he truly wants to resolve  
is not the time loop,  
but the anxiety and fear hidden within himself.  
Ethan resolved to confront  
his own heart.

"Alice,  
I'm scared.  
I'm afraid everything will change..."  
Ethan said, almost in tears.

"That's a feeling everyone carries.  
What’s important is  
to accept change.  
As long as I'm here,  
you’re not alone."  
Alice gently embraced  
Ethan.

In that moment,  
the clock tower quietly  
began to turn.  
Within the loop,  
Ethan's heart was liberated.  
Ethan's inner growth  
became the key to transcending the time loop.

In the next moment,  
Ethan saw at his feet  
a new world unfolding,  
the beautiful scenery of Azalea.  
Under the blue sky,  
Alice was smiling.  
Ethan decided  
he would no longer fear the past.

"Look, Ethan!  
We are free!"  
Alice's voice echoed.  
Ethan's heart cleared,  
and a new future  
spread out before him.  
Freed from the interstice of time,  
the two of them  
began a new adventure together.
