## The Dream of Youth, Dedicated to Soccer

On a sunny morning,  
Yuma looked up at the sky.  
"Today, I'm going to play soccer!"  
His friend, Ken, said.  

"Yeah, I'll do my best!"  
But Yuma felt a little uneasy.  
"I want to become a professional soccer player."  
He thought to himself.  

One day, the day of the match arrived.  
Yuma's hands were shaking,  
"What should I do? I hope I can do well."  
His heart was racing.  

As the match began,  
he chased after the ball, but  
he couldn't play well.  
"Yuma, hang in there!"  
Ken shouted.  

But Yuma kept failing.  
"What should I do? I want to get better."  
Yuma felt sad.  

That night, Yuma looked up at the starry sky,  
"How can I make my dream come true?"  
He pondered.  

"I need to practice more!"  
A determination was born in Yuma's heart.  
The next morning,  
Yuma was the first to arrive at the field.  

He battled with the ball,  
repeatedly taking shots.  
Even when he failed,  
Yuma kept going.  

His friends watched,  
"I’ll do my best too!"  
Everyone encouraged each other to practice.  

Months passed,  
and the day of the match came again.  
Yuma felt confident,  
and fought alongside his friends.  

"Yuma, you're amazing!"  
Ken cheered.  
"Thank you, it's all thanks to everyone."  
Yuma replied with a smile.  

After that,  
Yuma's team won the championship!  
"Yuma, let's keep chasing our dreams!"  
Ken encouraged him.  

"Yeah, if we're together,  
I'm sure our dreams will come true!"  
Yuma thought this from the bottom of his heart.  

In Yuma's eyes,  
a bright light was shining.  
Together with his friends,  
Yuma took one step at a time.  

The soccer field was  
a place filled with memories with friends.  
And,  
Yuma continued to run towards  
a new dream.  
In his heart,  
along with the soccer ball,  
there was hope and courage.
