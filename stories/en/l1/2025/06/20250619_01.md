## Beyond Eco-Anxiety

One afternoon,  
in a classroom in Green Town,  
Akihito was spending his time as usual.  
But inside his heart,  
there was a slight unease.  
It was the word "eco-anxiety."

"Hey, Akihito.  
Have you ever thought about the future?"  
His friend, Leah, asked.  
Akihito thought it was a bit scary.  
"Yeah, but it’s a little frightening.  
I can’t imagine what will happen to the Earth."

Seeing Akihito's anxiety,  
Leah looked at him with kind eyes.  
"But there are things we can do.  
For example, we can reduce plastic,  
or work hard on recycling."

Hearing those words,  
Akihito thought about it.  
He wondered if there was something he could do.  
His heart was swirling with  
environmental issues and his own feelings of helplessness.

One day,  
on his way home from school,  
Akihito found a small park  
littered with trash.  
His heart felt heavy.  
"Is there really nothing I can do?"  
He felt a bit down.  
But at that moment,  
he made a resolution.  
"I’ll start with what I can do."

The next day,  
Akihito gathered his friends  
and proposed an activity to clean up the park.  
"Let’s all pick up trash and make the park beautiful!"  
When he raised his voice,  
his friends, including Leah,  
enthusiastically joined him.  
They decided to make it a chance to think together.

On the day of the activity,  
Akihito stood in the park,  
nervous yet hopeful.  
As the children gathered  
and laughed while picking up trash,  
Akihito's anxiety gradually eased.  
He felt that by working together,  
they could accomplish things he couldn’t do alone.

After the activity,  
Akihito was amazed at the amount of trash they had collected.  
"I can’t believe there was this much trash."  
Leah said.  
Akihito felt warmth in his heart.  
"Our small actions might slowly turn into something bigger."

From that day on,  
Akihito embraced his anxiety  
and grew by taking action.  
Instead of fearing eco-anxiety,  
he found the strength to overcome it.

As time passed,  
Akihito spread activities at school  
and deepened connections with people in the community.  
His passion grew,  
and an environmental protection group was born where everyone could participate.  
Recognizing that he was a small existence,  
he found a light of hope by continuing to do what he could.

At a gathering one day,  
Akihito was talking and laughing with his friends.  
"The future is never dark;  
if we all join forces,  
we can surely create a bright world!"  
His words resonated with his friends,  
and they nodded in agreement.  
Everyone's smiles shone  
like the sun illuminating the future.

Thus, Akihito overcame eco-anxiety  
and gained the power to envision the future with his friends.  
Even if it was a small step,  
he learned that it could open the path to hope.  
In Akihito's heart,  
there was no longer any fear.  
The future was  
in their hands.
