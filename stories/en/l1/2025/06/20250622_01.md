## Wings of the Swift

On a sunny spring day,  
Kota was riding his bicycle with friends.  
Kota's dream was to own his own car.  
But that dream felt far away,  
and it made him sad.

"Hey, Kota.  
What kind of car do you want to ride?"  
His friend, Daiki, asked.

"Hmm,  
I’d like a Swift.  
It's small and easy to drive."  
Kota replied.  
The Swift was a popular car among everyone.

That day, when Kota returned home,  
his father was talking about the Swift.  
"The Swift is quite popular,"  
his father said happily.

But Kota felt uneasy.  
"Why does everyone choose the Swift?"  
That question lingered in Kota's mind.

As time passed,  
Kota became a third-year middle school student.  
While everyone was deciding their future paths,  
Kota was the only one who couldn't decide.

One day,  
there was a class discussion at school about "future cars."

"Everyone,  
what do you think cars will be like in the future?"  
the teacher asked,  
and many opinions from friends came pouring in.

"There will be more eco-cars!"  
a voice chimed in.

"Electric cars will become mainstream!"  
other friends added.  
Kota felt his dreams and anxieties mixing together.

On one such day,  
Kota met a girl named Haruka in the park.  
Haruka was part of a family that owned a Swift,  
and she went to school every day.

"Choosing is difficult,  
but it's best to choose what you truly value,"  
Haruka said.  
Her words resonated in Kota's heart.

"I don’t have to align my dreams with everyone else's expectations."  
Kota realized.  
To find what he truly wanted,  
he decided to embark on a journey.

Kota began to reflect on himself  
and started to challenge various things.  
With his friends,  
he learned traffic rules,  
and practiced driving.  
He also began to research the Swift.

As spring came to an end,  
Kota took a step forward to make his dream come true.  
He participated in a Swift showcase  
and felt the joy of driving.

"I want to ride a Swift.  
This is the future I choose!"  
That voice was a testament to Kota's newfound confidence.

Kota moved forward strongly  
to fulfill his dream.  
His encounter with Haruka helped him grow.

Thus, Kota firmly held onto his choices  
and spread his wings toward the future.  
In Kota's heart,  
the wings of the Swift expanded,  
and a hope to soar freely was born.
