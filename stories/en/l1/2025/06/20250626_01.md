## The Promise of the Sky, the Journey of the Road

In the year twenty-four of the new era,  
people were flying in the sky.  
New airplanes  
made journeys through the sky closer.  

There was a young man,  
Yoshuke Sakurai.  
He was burdened  
with anxiety in his heart.  

"Hey, Yoshuke,  
what's wrong?"  
Beside him was a robot,  
Alice.  

Alice looked at his face  
and gently asked.  
Yoshuke,  
looking into Alice's eyes,  

"Alice, I can't  
see the future."  
"I thought what my parents left behind  
was just an inheritance."  

"But recently,  
I realized it holds  
a special meaning."  
Alice pondered for a moment.  

"Inheritance is not just  
an object; it may be part of  
your very existence."  
Those words  
lit a spark in Yoshuke's heart.  

He remembered  
the model airplane his father had left behind.  

"Maybe that could be the key."  
Yoshuke, along with Alice,  
picked up his father's belongings.  

In his heart,  
his father's love and  
the adventure of the journey awaited.  
From the gaps in the model,  

something was visible.  
It was a small note.  
"Yoshuke, you have  
a special talent."  

"Flying in the sky is  
not just a dream.  
In your ancestry,  
there were great pilots."  

"Carry on their spirit,  
and dance in the sky."  
Those words  
surprised Yoshuke.  

"The spirit of my ancestors flows within me."  
In his heart,  
a new hope began to sprout.  
At that moment, Alice said,  

"Let's go, Yoshuke.  
To seize your future."  
Encouraged by Alice's words,  
Yoshuke,  

based on his father's model,  
obtained the blueprints for a new airplane.  
He believed in the spirit of adventure,  

and every day he put in the effort.  
Alice was always by his side.  

A few months later,  
Yoshuke faced his first  
flight.  
His heart raced,  

"Yes! Yoshuke!  
Your dream is about to take flight!"  
Alice's voice  
echoed in his ears.  

And then,  
he grasped the controls  
and began to pilot.  
Expectations soared into the sky,  

and he felt the hearts of his father  
and ancestors. "The sky is mine!"  
Yoshuke shouted.  

When the flight was successful,  
he saw a new  
horizon of the world.  
The vast blue sky enveloped him,  

and the free wind  
liberated his heart.  
It was a sign that he had  
embraced his roots,  

and had grown.  
When he returned to the ground,  
Yoshuke smiled at Alice. "Thank you, Alice."  

"Because you were here,  
I could reach this moment."  
Joyful light  
shone in Alice's eyes.  

"Our journey together  
will continue from now on,  
Yoshuke."  
The journey of the sky  

became not just an experience for him,  
but a special time to feel  
the bonds of family.  
And he began to  

draw his future  
with confidence.
