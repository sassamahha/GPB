## The Flower of Lost Effort

In the spring of 2084,  
the breeze was gentle,  
and the earth was full of life.  
Takumi gazed out the window,  
watching the cherry blossoms.  
It felt a bit nostalgic.  

Before Takumi,  
there was a robot named Leo.  
Leo had a blue body,  
and lived together with Takumi.  

"Takumi,  
what kind of day  
will you spend today?"  
Leo's voice was  
as gentle as the spring sunlight.  

Takumi thought for a moment.  
"Well, lately,  
I've been leaving all the work  
to the robots,  
and I want to try something.  
But I don't know  
what I should do."  

Leo tilted its head.  
"Then,  
is there anything I can help with?  
It might be fun to plant flowers together  
or cook."  

Takumi felt troubled.  
In a world where all tasks  
were left to robots,  
he had forgotten the meaning  
of putting in effort.  
His own existence  
might be fading away.  
It was as if  
the flowers were wilting without blooming.  

One day,  
Takumi suddenly had an idea.  
"Leo,  
let's use infinite energy  
to do something special.  
Creating something  
is what I need."  

Leo's eyes sparkled.  
"In that case,  
why don't we try  
to create a new type of flower?  
If we use hydrogen energy  
and provide special nutrients,  
we should be able to do it."  

Takumi's heart danced  
at the idea.  
He began researching flowers  
together with Leo.  
Using hydrogen,  
they created new nutrients  
and cultivated flowers  
of various colors and fragrances.  

Every day,  
he touched the soil,  
moved his hands,  
and repeated experiments with Leo.  
Before long,  
a new spark  
was born in Takumi's heart.  

Eventually,  
their efforts bore fruit,  
and beautiful flowers bloomed  
that they had never seen before.  
These flowers  
captivated those around them  
and received numerous awards.  

In that moment,  
Takumi realized,  
"The joy of putting in effort  
was indeed right here in my hands."  

"Takumi,  
our flowers  
are making people happy,"  
Leo said with a smile.  

Takumi was enveloped  
in deep emotion.  
"That's right, Leo.  
What we created  
warms someone's heart.  
It is effort itself  
that brings true value."  

After that,  
Takumi continued  
further research on flowers  
together with Leo.  
Feeling his own growth,  
he discovered a new value in life.  

In the spring of 2084,  
under the fully bloomed cherry trees,  
Takumi laughed with Leo.  
In his heart,  
the flower of effort,  
which would never be lost again,  
was blooming brightly.
