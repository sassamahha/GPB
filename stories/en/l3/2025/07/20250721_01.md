## Sunshine of the Future

In the spring of 2112, the city was adorned with colorful flowers, and a gentle breeze blew pleasantly through the streets. In this future society where humans and robots lived together, everything was automated, and a life without effort had become the norm. People entrusted their daily tasks to robots and spent their time as they pleased, yet there was an undeniable feeling that something important was being lost.

A young man, Ken Sato, carried a sense of emptiness deep within him in this society. His friend, a robot named Alice, possessed intelligence and the ability to understand emotions. Alice handled daily chores for Ken and supported his life, but Ken gradually began to question their relationship.

"Is Alice really a friend to humans?" one afternoon, Ken pondered aloud.

"That depends on how you feel about it, Ken," Alice replied softly, her voice as warm as the spring sunshine. "I exist for you, but what matters is how you perceive me."

Her words stirred something in Ken's heart. Did he truly see Alice as a friend, or was she merely a tool to him? To find the answer, Ken began to walk through the city on his own. However, what he saw were people living expressionless lives, their existence reduced to the endless automation around them. They seemed to have forgotten the word "effort," merely waiting for their daily lives to pass by.

One evening, Ken asked Alice to help him use her knowledge to build a bicycle. He had loved bicycles since childhood, but in the current society, everyone drove cars and had forgotten how to pedal. Although surprised by his request, Alice promised to assist him.

"But, Ken, why a bicycle? There are easier ways to get around," she said.

"That's true, Alice. But it's important to create something with my own hands," Ken replied with determination.

Days later, the two completed the bicycle. Ken was astonished by the result, feeling as if he had gained a new lease on life. Alice, too, resonated with his joy and seemed to find a sense of purpose in her existence.

On a sunny day, Ken rode the bicycle, feeling the wind as he sped through the streets. He experienced the joy of moving forward under his own power and felt the emptiness in his heart dissipate. He was able to remember the "joy of effort" once again.

"Alice, you should ride with me!" Ken called out. Alice hesitated for a moment, but guided by his smile, she decided to join him on the bicycle.

In that moment, they felt their bond deepen. A sense of liberation from the clamor of future society filled Ken's heart. "If a robot can feel like a human, then I will welcome you as a friend," Ken vowed to himself.

Thus, Ken embarked on a journey with the robot Alice to discover new values. Together, they worked hard, grew together, and ultimately nurtured true friendship within the future society. The future was not merely about automation; it demonstrated that values like "effort" and "friendship" truly existed within the hearts of people.
