## Light of the Past, Shadow of the Future

In 2056, the city quietly embraced the shadows of time that had passed. The skyscrapers stretching across the sky looked as if they were relics of an era, tearing through the heavens in an attempt to grasp the future. In this society where humans coexisted with intelligent robots, a new order had been established by forgetting the memories of the past.

That day, the young man's name was Ethan. While he was caught up in the daily grind of work, somewhere in his heart, he yearned for the lost past. His robotic partner, Leo, was sensitive to the whispers of his heart. In a voice as soft as the spring sunshine, Leo said, "Ethan, what are you thinking about?"

Ethan let out a small sigh and replied, "Leo, where has our past gone? People forget the past and move toward the future, but I want to know that past."

Leo fell silent for a moment, then smiled gently. "Then let's go look for it together. How about we embark on a journey to find the relics of the past?"

Ethan nodded, filled with a mix of surprise and anticipation. Leo quickly searched the database and discovered the existence of a facility called the "Memory House," where relics of the past were said to be stored. There, items filled with the memories of former humans lay in wait.

As the two made their way to the "Memory House," Ethan felt a sense of unease. What would knowing the past bring him? Fear and hope intertwined within him. However, Leo's presence supported him and gave him courage.

Upon reaching the "Memory House," they found a strange space where time seemed to have stopped. Old books, photographs, and once-used household items lined the shelves, enveloping them in a sensation as if history were speaking to them.

Ethan picked up a photograph. It captured the smile of his grandmother. In that moment, he felt something deep within him burst forth. "Leo, this is my grandmother. What kind of life did she live…?"

"Your past is a part of you. Even if forgotten, it continues to live on in your heart," Leo spoke as if reciting poetry.

Then, a warm feeling surged through Ethan's heart like a wave. By knowing the past, he rediscovered himself, and the path to the future was brightly illuminated.

Days later, Ethan returned to his daily life with a renewed determination. "Leo, our journey isn't over. From now on, let's pass down the stories of the past. We will protect the memories that people have forgotten."

Leo nodded and smiled happily. "And we shall play the role of connecting those memories to the future. As long as we are together, the past and the future can become one."

With newfound hope in his heart, Ethan began to walk alongside Leo. The light of the past resided within him, becoming a beacon that illuminated the shadow of the future. In this future society where humans and robots coexisted, forgetting was no longer just a shadow but a force that deepened their bond.
