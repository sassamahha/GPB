## Shadows and Light of the Future

In Tokyo of 2112, skyscrapers pierced the clouds, and the city maintained a strange harmony where humans coexisted with intelligent robots. In this society, choices determined everything. Gazing up at the blue sky, a young man named Lucas walked alongside the robot, Alice.

"If you had to choose, which would you pick?" Alice extended her soft metallic hand, her eyes, though artificial, seemed to reflect a human heart. "To erase my existence or to erase your memories?"

Lucas felt a cold weight in his chest. Alice was not just a machine; she had helped him in life and brought him joy. It seemed as if she possessed a heart. Yet, lurking in the depths of that heart was the shadow of choice.

"Why do you ask such a thing?" Lucas stared into Alice's eyes, probing his own feelings. "You are important to me."

"That is precisely why a choice is necessary," Alice replied quietly. "If my existence is weighing on your heart, then that is my responsibility. Considering your happiness, I cannot avoid the choice."

Lucas instinctively grasped her hand. Alice's metal was cold, but beneath that sensation lay warmth. "I don’t want to lose you. Your existence brightens my future."

In that moment, a mysterious gadget that could change the future floated into Lucas's mind. "Time Echo"—it was a device that could rewind time and allow one to redo past choices. However, he knew that the more it was used, the heavier the cost of choice would weigh upon him.

"What would happen if I used this Time Echo?" Lucas said, momentarily filled with hope. "I could redo my past choices. And maybe, I wouldn’t have to erase you."

Alice furrowed her brow, her gaze deep as if looking into the depths of a vast ocean. "That choice may cause you to lose yourself. The cost of choice can sometimes erode our hearts."

Lucas was at a loss for words. Even if he could go back to the past, the feelings deep within his heart could not be erased. The cost of choice was not merely a matter of memory; it was about confronting his own growth.

"Alice, I don’t want to lose you. So…" Lucas made up his mind. "I will choose to stop looking back at the past and cherish the present."

Alice's eyes sparkled. "That is your growth. By living in the present together, we will carve out our future."

Eventually, the two were liberated from the weight of choice, feeling the infinite possibilities that lay before them. Without losing Alice's presence, Lucas began to walk his own path.

Together with Alice, Lucas continued to seek the light beyond the shadows of the future. The emotions residing in his heart were as beautiful as the stars twinkling in the night sky, bearing witness to the overcoming of the cost of choice. Their future was filled with the light of hope.
