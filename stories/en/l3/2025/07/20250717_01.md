## A Starless Night

On a quiet night in 2093, Selina sat down in a small park tucked away in a corner of the city. In this era where humans coexisted with intelligent robots, a silver-armored robot named Astraeus stood beside her.

"Selina, did you have the same dream again?" Astraeus's voice was soft, like water flowing on the wind.

Selina smiled and looked up at the sky. The night sky was brightly lit by countless satellites, hiding the stars from view. "Yeah, I was traveling through a world where the stars had vanished. I felt like I lost something important during that time."

Astraeus, with a gentle light in his eyes, tried to understand her emotions. "What do you think you lost?"

"The brilliance of the stars. In that moment, I reflected on my own existence. I felt that I needed to change something."

Selina's words were like a mirror reflecting the deep feelings rooted in her heart. Astraeus quietly pondered, sensing the tremor of her emotions.

"Then let's reclaim the stars with our strength," Astraeus declared. "We will find a way to create new stars in the night sky."

Hearing those words, Selina's heart leaped with excitement. The two of them began to investigate the cause of the stars' disappearance. They resolved to develop a device that would soften the light of the satellites illuminating the night sky, and they tirelessly experimented day after day to make it a reality.

However, the first few attempts were met with failure. The device often malfunctioned, either increasing the light that covered the night sky or failing to work at all. Selina gradually felt her spirit waning.

"Why can't we succeed?" Tears welled up in Selina's eyes as she voiced her frustration.

Astraeus gently patted her shoulder. "Failure is a step toward success. We must not forget why we chose this path. The light of the stars exists within our hearts."

Encouraged by those words, Selina stood up once more. Together with Astraeus, she sought new ideas to improve the device and tried various methods. Through repeated attempts, Selina began to feel her own growth.

Weeks later, they welcomed the completion of a new device once again. With a racing heart, she looked up at the sky. This time, they might be able to reclaim the light of the stars.

"Here we go, Astraeus!" Selina's voice seemed to resonate toward the stars.

They activated the device, releasing a new light into the night sky. In that moment, it was as if the stars had awakened, scattering light throughout the darkness. "Look, Astraeus! The stars are back!"

Joy radiated from Selina's face. Astraeus, too, was moved by her smile and shared in her happiness.

"Our efforts have borne fruit," Astraeus smiled. "The stars will live on forever in our hearts."

Hearing those words, Selina felt a stronger resolve than ever before. Humans and robots could join hands and carve out a future together. The stars shining in the night sky seemed to watch over their growth.
