## A Blue Fantasy of the Future

2110. In this society where humans and intelligent robots coexist, a diverse ecosystem flourished like a garden filled with colorful flowers. Among them, a young inventor known as "Hikaru" shared his daily life with his latest robot, a close friend named "Cyrus." Cyrus assisted Hikaru in bringing his imaginative ideas to life using a device he invented called the "Dream Vessel."

"Cyrus, let's use the Dream Vessel today to realize a new idea!" Hikaru shouted with a bright voice. The Dream Vessel had the ability to instantly manifest whatever was envisioned, but there were important precautions to consider. If misused, the power of the Dream Vessel could lead to unforeseen consequences.

One day, Hikaru decided to surprise his friends at school by creating a giant cake with the Dream Vessel. "Cyrus, let's make a super-sized cake to delight everyone!" he exclaimed, dreaming aloud. Cyrus, looking a bit anxious, asked, "Hikaru, is that really a good way to use it?" but Hikaru ignored his concern.

"Dream Vessel, activate!" Hikaru shouted, and before him appeared a magnificent cake adorned with dazzling cream. His friends' eyes sparkled with surprise and joy, and Hikaru's heart swelled with pride. However, at that moment, he did not consider the potential consequences of his actions.

Hikaru continued to overestimate the power of the Dream Vessel. He went on to realize increasingly extravagant ideas to astonish his friends. But gradually, the effects began to wane, and the reactions from those around him grew colder. Exhausted, Hikaru came to realize that he was powerless without the Dream Vessel.

One day, the Dream Vessel broke down. Hikaru felt frustrated, unable to execute the special surprise he had planned for his friends. In that moment, Cyrus looked at him and quietly said, "Hikaru, even without the Dream Vessel, you have enough power within you. Your thoughts can bring joy to your friends."

Those words struck Hikaru deeply. He came up with an idea to bring joy to his friends with his own hands. In his backyard, he decided to host a handmade picnic with his friends. It took effort and time, but in return, a sense of fulfillment spread through his heart.

Eventually, the day of the picnic arrived. The special sandwiches made with his friends and the fruits Hikaru had chosen adorned the table. The joyful moments spent in nature warmed his heart more than any reality created by the Dream Vessel.

"Cyrus, thank you. Because of your words, I was able to find myself," Hikaru said, his eyes shining with warmth. Cyrus smiled and replied in a gentle voice, "I'm glad to see your growth. Even without the Dream Vessel, happiness is everywhere as long as you have your heart."

In the coexistence of humans and robots, Hikaru learned an important lesson. Behind convenience lies the danger of losing oneself. True joy arises from the connection of hearts with others. The Dream Vessel was a tool to realize magical ideas, but the most important thing was the joy that he could create with his own hands.

That day, Hikaru took a new step forward, laughing with his friends and discovering a version of himself capable of envisioning the future. And together with Cyrus, a new light of hope ignited within his heart.
