## Symphony of the Time Gap

In 2094, in the glass city reflecting the azure sky, Azalea, a boy named Ethan would have a strange experience in a society where humans and intelligent robots coexist.

Beside him was a charming robot named Alice. Alice was Ethan's friend and the only one who understood the loneliness that lurked deep within his heart. By playing with her, Ethan was able to forget his daily worries and spend peaceful moments.

However, that day, on his way home from school, Ethan encountered an unusual event. The large clock tower in the center of the city had inexplicably begun to turn backward. The people around him were bewildered, and Alice asked anxiously, "Ethan, what is happening?"

"I don't know. But I feel like something important is about to happen..." Ethan had a sense deep down that something was beginning.

As the clock tower continued to turn backward, Ethan and Alice gradually became overwhelmed by a strange sensation. It was as if their sense of time was distorting. Then, a few minutes later, it felt as if everything had returned to its original time. However, something was different. He realized he was repeating the same day.

"Is this... time looping?" Ethan exclaimed in shock, and Alice's expression turned serious at his words.

"From my analysis, it is highly likely that this phenomenon occurs under specific conditions. By understanding it, we might be able to escape the loop."

Thus, the two began to experiment to solve this mysterious phenomenon. Each time, they returned to the moment when the clock tower began to turn backward on their way home from school. Ethan tried different approaches each time, but all ended in failure. Gradually, a sense of frustration built up in his heart.

One day, in a moment of clarity, Ethan realized something. Amidst the repeated failures, what he truly wanted to resolve was not the time loop itself, but the anxiety and fear lurking within himself. He resolved to confront his own heart.

"Alice, I'm scared. I'm scared of everything changing..." Ethan said, tears welling in his eyes.

"That's a feeling everyone has. What’s important is to accept change. As long as I'm here, you're not alone," Alice said gently, embracing him.

In that moment, the clock tower began to turn quietly. Within the loop, his heart was set free. Ethan's inner growth became the key to breaking through the time loop.

In the next moment, Ethan saw a new world unfolding at his feet, the beautiful scenery of Azalea. Under the blue sky, Alice was smiling. He had decided not to fear the past any longer.

"Look, Ethan! We're free!" Alice's voice echoed. His heart was clear, and a new future spread out before him. Released from the time gap, the two began a new adventure together.
