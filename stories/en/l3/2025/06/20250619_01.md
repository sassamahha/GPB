## Beyond Eco-Anxiety

On a quiet afternoon, in a classroom of a middle school nestled in a lush green corner of the city, the protagonist, Akihito, was going about his usual routine. However, deep within his heart, a faint shadow of anxiety lingered. It was the term "eco-anxiety," which he had recently started to hear more often.

"Hey, Akihito. Have you ever thought about the future?" his friend, Rei, asked. Every time Akihito heard such words, he felt a stirring in his chest. He replied in a small voice, "Yeah, but it’s a bit scary. I can’t imagine what will happen to the Earth."

Rei looked at Akihito, who was feeling anxious, and offered him a gentle gaze. "But there are things we can do. For example, we can reduce plastic use or work hard on recycling."

At her words, Akihito pondered whether there was something he could do. His heart was swirling with both concern for environmental issues and a sense of helplessness.

One day, on his way home from school, Akihito noticed a small park where trash was scattered everywhere. His heart sank. He felt enveloped by a dark mood, thinking that perhaps he couldn’t do anything at all. However, at that moment, he made a firm resolution. "I’ll start with what I can do."

The next day, Akihito gathered his friends and proposed a school beautification project. "Let’s all pick up trash and make the park a little cleaner!" he exclaimed, and his friends, including Rei, agreed. They decided to create an opportunity not just for cleaning but for thinking about environmental issues.

On the day of the activity, Akihito stood in the park, his feelings a mix of nervousness and anticipation. Watching the children gather and happily pick up trash, he felt his inner anxiety gradually easing. He realized that by working together, they could accomplish things that seemed impossible alone.

When the activity ended, Akihito was astonished by the amount of trash they had collected with his friends. "I can’t believe there was this much trash around us," Rei said thoughtfully. Akihito felt a warm light shining in his heart. "Our small actions might slowly become a bigger force."

Since that day, Akihito accepted his anxiety and grew by taking action. Instead of fearing eco-anxiety, he found the strength to overcome it.

As time passed, Akihito expanded the activities at school and deepened his connections with the local community. His passion spread to those around him, creating a circle of environmental protection that everyone could join. While acknowledging his smallness, he continued to do what he could, finding a glimmer of hope.

During a gathering one day, Akihito was talking and laughing with his friends. "The future is never dark; if we all work together, we can surely create a brighter world!" His words resonated with his friends, who nodded in agreement. Their smiles shone like the sun illuminating the future.

Thus, Akihito overcame eco-anxiety and developed the power to envision the future alongside his friends. He learned that even a small step could open the path to hope. There was no longer fear in his heart. The future was in their hands.
