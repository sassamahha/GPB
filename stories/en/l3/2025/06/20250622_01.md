## Wings of Swift

On a sunny spring day, under the blue sky, a boy named Kyle was riding his bicycle with his friends. In his heart, he held a dream of someday owning his own car. However, that dream always felt distant, like something just out of reach. As Kyle looked up at the colorful cars lined up on the street corners, a small anxiety stirred within him.

"Hey, Kyle. What kind of car do you want to drive in the future?" his friend Jake asked.

"Hmm, maybe a Swift. It's compact and economical, and it seems easy to drive," Kyle replied. The Swift was a popular car in his town, especially since his father had praised it for its "great fuel efficiency."

That day, when Kyle returned home, he overheard his father talking about the new Swift. His father passionately described the car's appeal, proudly mentioning that it had been loved by many for twenty years. Yet, a sense of unease spread in Kyle's heart. "Why do so many people choose the Swift?" That question quietly swirled in the depths of his mind.

As time passed, Kyle became a third-year middle school student. As the season for high school entrance exams approached, his anxiety grew. While his friends were deciding on their futures, he remained uncertain. One day, a discussion about "Choosing Future Cars" took place in class.

"What does everyone think? What will cars be like in the future?" the teacher asked, and classmates' opinions began to fly around.

"I think eco-cars will become more common!" a bright voice chimed in.

"Electric cars will be the mainstream, right?" another friend added. As Kyle listened to these opinions, he felt his own dreams and anxieties intertwining. He realized he was merely being swept along by the opinions of those around him, without truly understanding what he wanted.

One day, Kyle met a girl in the neighborhood park. Her name was Sarah. She was part of a family that owned a Swift and commuted to school every day. They naturally started a conversation, and something Sarah said resonated deeply with Kyle.

"It's hard to choose, but I think the best thing is to pick what you truly value. I chose the Swift not just for my family, but because I felt comfortable with it."

In that moment, something clicked in Kyle's heart. He resolved to embark on a journey to find what he truly sought, rather than conforming his dreams to others' expectations.

Little by little, Kyle began to reflect on himself and started to take on various challenges. He learned traffic rules and practiced driving with his friends. He also began researching the structure and fuel efficiency of the Swift to understand its appeal. Gradually, confidence began to blossom within him.

As spring came to a close, Kyle was able to take a step toward realizing his dream. He participated in a Swift test drive and experienced the joy of driving it. Finally, he was certain of his choice.

"I want to drive a Swift. This is the future I choose!"

That voice was a testament to the confidence that had welled up from his heart. Like a Swift soaring toward the future, Kyle moved forward with determination to fulfill his dreams. His encounter with Sarah had helped him grow.

Thus, Kyle firmly held onto his choice and spread his wings toward the future. In his heart, the wings of the Swift expanded, harboring the hope that he could fly freely anywhere.
