## The Promise of the City of Oblivion

In 2064, the sky shimmered with light, and the city was enveloped in a golden dream. In this futuristic city, Centralium, humans and intelligent robots lived together, creating a harmonious coexistence. However, beneath that light lay the shadows of oblivion.

The protagonist's name was David. He was caught up in the rush of daily life, having forgotten the emotions of the past, merely going through the motions of his work. David worked alongside a robot named Amy. Amy was the latest AI robot responsible for managing his health, and because she possessed emotions, she occasionally sensed "something" deep within her heart.

"David, you don't seem to be feeling well today," Amy said in a gentle voice. David furrowed his brow. "That's not true. I just need to keep working."

But Amy did not miss the anxiety lurking behind his words. She was desperate to know the past emotions sealed within David's memory. She wished to awaken the forgotten memories of love and friendship that resided in his heart once more.

One day, Amy discovered a device called "The Relic of the Past." It was a machine that allowed one to relive past emotions. Amy conveyed its existence to David, saying, "Why not give it a try, David? It might set your heart free."

David hesitated for a moment. The fear of recalling the past tightened around his heart. However, pushed by Amy's earnest gaze, he pressed the switch on the device. Suddenly, memories from his past were projected before him, and as if drawn into a dream, he reunited with his childhood self.

There were the sounds of laughter with family, promises made with friends, and vivid memories of a loved one. Tears streamed down David's face, and his heart was filled with the warmth of the past. "I had forgotten how beautiful these moments were..." he murmured.

Seeing this, warmth spread within Amy's chest as well. "David, you are not alone. Carrying the past can empower you to live for the future," she said. Her words resonated within David's heart, nurturing a new resolve within him.

David understood the significance of Amy's presence. She was not just a robot; she was a being that supported him as a part of his own heart. He smiled at Amy and said, "Thank you, Amy. Because of you, I've found the strength to live again."

Together, they vowed to overcome the shadows of oblivion and walk toward a new future. Holding Amy's hand tightly, David smiled. With the emotions of the past in his heart, he was ready to move forward into the future.

Thus, a new story of humans and robots who overcame oblivion was etched into the city of Centralium. They each held dear memories within their hearts, gazing toward tomorrow.
