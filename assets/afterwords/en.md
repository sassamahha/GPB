## Afterword

**A slightly strange tale woven in a world where humans and robots live together.**

_Road to 2112_ is a collection of short stories set in a future where living alongside AI has become normal.  
In a society where robots are friends, colleagues, and quiet companions, what emotions do humans feel, and what choices do they make?

These stories gently explore those subtle emotional shifts and small inner changes, told in a warm, heartfelt style.

It’s less "science fiction" and more "slightly fantastical."  
Here you’ll find fragments of a gentle, softer future—pieces that make you pause and wonder, "What kind of future will I choose from now on?"
