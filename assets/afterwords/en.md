## Afterword

**A slightly mysterious story set in a world where humans and robots live together.**

"Road to 2112" is a collection of short stories set in a future where living with AI is the norm.  
In a society where robots are friends, coworkers, and quiet companions, what emotions do humans feel, and what choices do they make?  
These tales gently portray subtle shifts of the heart in a warm narrative voice.

What you'll find here are soft, tender fragments of the future—  
more **SF as in “Slightly Fantastic”** than Science Fiction.

If this makes you pause and ask, “What kind of future will I choose?”, then I’m glad.
